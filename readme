# Handwriting Recognition with Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

This project implements a digit recognition system using Hidden Markov Models trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Uses HMMs to model handwritten digits (0â€“9)
- Feature extraction via vertical slicing
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Visual display of sample predictions

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
